MotherTongue is an Android application written mainly in Kotlin that, through gamification, incentives users to learn new languages in a similar way they have learnt their mother tongue, by exploring the surroundings, regardless other humans work involvement on the learning process.

For achieving that, a list of words based on user’s context, place and activity is proposed and translated to the language that users have previously chosen. 

Users, through the device’s camera, are invited to search around an object, animal, food or activity meanwhile objects already recognized on screen are translated by MotherTongue and shown in real time.
